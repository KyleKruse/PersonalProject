Prompt #4: Roman Numeral Equivalent of Decimal Values

### Info

This was compiled on Windows.

- krusePP.c is the actual project

- oleSimple.c was a super simple answer to the prompt and not really engaging.

- Narrative.txt gives a brief overview of the program and its features.

- pseudocode.txt is as it sounds like.


### To-Do

Currently program only converts from number to Roman. Need to implement Roman to number functionality.
