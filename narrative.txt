Assuming you know the password to the program (hint: it's "idf") it will:
    Ask you for a number
    Convert said number into a Roman numeral
    Output aforementioned Roman numeral

The program will only accept numbers as input. These numbers are restricted to between 1 and 1000.

There's also some surprises for you to find. (hint: What numbers are funny?)
